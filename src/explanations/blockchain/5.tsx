            <strong>What’s the Difference Between a Private Blockchain and a Public Blockchain?</strong>
            <p>
                A public blockchain, also known as an open or permissionless blockchain, is one where anybody can join the network freely and establish a node. Because of their open nature, these blockchains must be secured with cryptography and a consensus system like proof of work (PoW). A private or permissioned blockchain, on the other hand, requires each node to be approved before joining. Because nodes are considered to be trusted, the layers of security do not need to be as robust.

                Decentralization should be applied where it makes sense. Just because it’s a blockchain application doesn’t mean it needs to be 100% decentralized. The goal of any blockchain solution is to deliver what the users of that solution need, and this may or may not include certain levels of decentralization. To better understand decentralized networks, the table below breaks out how decentralized networks compare to the more common centralized and distributed networks.

                Each network architecture has its benefits and tradeoffs. For example, decentralized blockchain systems, unlike distributed systems, typically prioritize security over performance. So, when a blockchain network scales up or out, the network becomes more secure, but performance slows down because each member node must validate all data being added to the ledger. Adding members to a decentralized network can make it safer, but not necessarily faster.
