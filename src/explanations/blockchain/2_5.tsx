                As we’ve seen, most of these alternative protocols employ some type of pay-to-play scheme. Proof of capacity is no different, but here you 'pay' with hard drive space. The more hard drive space you have, the better your chance of mining the next block and earning the block reward.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to mining in a proof-of-capacity system, the algorithm generates large data sets known as 'plots', which you store on your hard drive. The more plots you have, the better your chance of finding the next block in the chain.
