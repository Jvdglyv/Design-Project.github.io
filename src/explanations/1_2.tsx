                A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes.
                They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure
                and decentralized record

                Some companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever,
                among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food
                products take to get to their locations.

                Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria;
                in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken
                weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.

                Using blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it
                makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come
                in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving
                lives.
                This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.
